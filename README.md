A linux sound visualization and simple PDE-solver engine using openGl and alsalib. 
One thread captures an alsa device and another thread feeds the fourier data into a simple opengl engine. 
By using a render to texture technique, it is capable of solving partial differential with finite differences methods 
on the shader hardware ..
It's very simple and meant to be an excercise/tutorial for linux sound and opengl programming.
